# Successful Maximum Asset Liquidation Test: Design Summary

This test case provides a crucial safeguard for the Lendefi protocol. By demonstrating that liquidation works properly with 20 different assets (the maximum allowed), you've verified your protocol can handle the most complex liquidation scenario possible.

## Key Design Elements

1. **Comprehensive Asset Setup**:
   - Creating 20 unique tokens with distinct names and symbols
   - Configuring each with its own price oracle
   - Using consistent collateralization parameters (80% LTV, 85% liquidation threshold)

2. **Realistic Position Building**:
   - Using consistent 5 ETH amounts for each asset
   - Borrowing at 98% of max capacity
   - Creating a properly collateralized position

3. **Controlled Price Movement**:
   - 15% price drop is precisely calibrated to trigger liquidation
   - Updated on all 20 oracles simultaneously

4. **Thorough Verification**:
   - Checking position is actually liquidatable before attempting
   - Gas measurement to ensure feasibility
   - Verifying all 20 assets transfer correctly to the liquidator
   - Confirming the position's debt is fully cleared

## Gas Efficiency Achievements

The test demonstrated that the liquidation function is remarkably efficient, using only ~1.38 million gas to process the liquidation of 20 different assets. This is well within Ethereum's block gas limits.

This efficiency is critical for a lending protocol, as it ensures liquidations will remain executable even in extreme market conditions where many positions may need liquidation simultaneously.
