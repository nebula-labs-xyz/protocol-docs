## Overview

The PartnerVesting contract implements a linear token vesting mechanism designed for partner allocations within the Lendefi DAO ecosystem. It provides controlled token distribution with cancellation capabilities, allowing the parent Ecosystem contract to reclaim unvested tokens if a partnership ends.

## Architecture & Design

### Design Pattern
The contract employs a hub-and-spoke architecture where:
- The Ecosystem contract acts as a central hub, creating and managing individual vesting instances
- Each PartnerVesting contract serves as a spoke, handling vesting for a single partner

### Inheritance
- **Ownable2Step**: Provides two-step ownership transfer for enhanced security
- **ReentrancyGuard**: Protects against reentrancy attacks
- **Context**: Provides execution context information

### Storage Design
The contract optimizes gas usage with:
- **Immutable Variables**: All core parameters are immutable, saving gas and preventing modifications
- **Minimal State**: Only tracks released tokens as mutable state
- **Type-Appropriate Storage**: Uses uint64 for timestamps to optimize storage

## Token Vesting Mechanism

### Implementation Approach
The vesting follows a simple linear model:
- Tokens vest continuously from start time to end time
- No cliff period (vesting begins immediately at start)
- Vested amount calculation: `totalAllocation * (currentTime - startTime) / duration`

### Vesting Calculation
The implementation correctly handles edge cases:
- Before start: 0 tokens vested
- After end: 100% tokens vested
- During vesting: Linear proportion based on elapsed time
- Already released tokens are properly accounted for
