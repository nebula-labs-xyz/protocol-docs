# Lendefi Oracle: A Comprehensive Technical Overview

The LendefiOracle module is a sophisticated price oracle system designed to provide secure, reliable, and manipulation-resistant price data for the Lendefi Protocol. It implements multiple layers of protection to ensure the integrity of financial operations that depend on accurate market prices.

## Core Architecture

### Multi-Oracle Design
- **Redundant Data Sources**: Aggregates price data from multiple oracles per asset
- **Median Calculation**: Uses statistical median to eliminate outliers and price manipulation attempts
- **Configurable Requirements**: Customizable minimum oracle count per asset

### Price Feed Integration
- **Chainlink Compatible**: Primarily designed for Chainlink price feeds (AggregatorV3Interface)
- **Decimal Handling**: Normalizes different oracle decimal formats
- **Historical Data**: Leverages historical rounds for price change analysis

## Security Mechanisms

### Price Validation
1. **Basic Validation**
   - Ensures prices are positive
   - Verifies round completeness (answeredInRound >= roundId)

2. **Freshness Checks**
   - Configurable maximum age for price data (default: 8 hours)
   - Stricter freshness requirements during high volatility (default: 1 hour)
   - Prevents using outdated prices during critical market conditions

3. **Volatility Protection**
   - Detects significant price movements between rounds
   - Default threshold: 20% change triggers stricter freshness requirements
   - Rejects volatile prices that aren't sufficiently recent

### Circuit Breakers

1. **Automatic Circuit Breakers**
   - Triggered when price changes exceed configured threshold (default: 50%)
   - Prevents trading based on potentially manipulated or anomalous prices
   - Reverts with detailed diagnostics for investigation

2. **Manual Controls**
   - Authorized roles can manually trigger/reset circuit breakers
   - Provides emergency override during market anomalies
   - Governance control for extreme situations

### Fallback Mechanisms

Implements a cascading fallback strategy when primary price determination fails:
1. **Primary Oracle**: Attempts to use designated primary oracle if median calculation fails
2. **Historical Prices**: Falls back to last valid price if it's recent enough
3. **Graceful Failure**: Provides detailed error information when no valid price is available

## Admin Controls

### Role-Based Access
- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Global administrative capabilities
- **ORACLE_MANAGER_ROLE**: Can add/remove oracles and adjust thresholds
- **CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ROLE**: Can manually trigger/reset circuit breakers
- **UPGRADER_ROLE**: Can authorize contract upgrades

### Configurable Thresholds
- Freshness threshold (8 hours default)
- Volatility threshold (1 hour default)
- Volatility percentage (20% default)
- Circuit breaker threshold (50% default)
- Minimum oracles required (2 default)

## Integration Points

### Main External Interface
- `getAssetPrice(address asset)`: Primary function for obtaining verified asset prices

### Oracle Management
- Functions to add, remove, and configure oracles
- Primary oracle designation
- Asset-specific configuration options

## Implementation Highlights

1. **QuickSort Algorithm**: Efficient median calculation for multiple price feeds
2. **Try/Catch Design**: Robust error handling to manage oracle failures gracefully
3. **Event Emission**: Comprehensive events for off-chain monitoring
4. **Upgradeable Design**: UUPS pattern for future enhancements
5. **Gas Optimizations**: Efficient data structures and algorithms for lower execution costs

This oracle system represents a production-grade solution that balances security, reliability, and gas efficiency while protecting against the various vulnerabilities that typically affect price oracle systems in DeFi.
